# Example Workflow

This is a placeholder file demonstrating how to add Alfred workflows.

To add a real workflow:

1. Download a `.alfredworkflow` file
2. Place it in this directory (replacing this file)
3. Rebuild your nix-darwin configuration

Popular workflows you might want to add:

- Color UI workflow for color picking and conversion
- Convert units workflow for unit conversions
- Terminal Finder workflow for quick terminal/finder navigation
- GitHub workflow for searching repositories

The workflow management system will automatically install any `.alfredworkflow` files placed in this directory.
