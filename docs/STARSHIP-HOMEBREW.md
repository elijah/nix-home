# 🚀 Starship Shell Prompt - Homebrew Installation

## Changes Made

### ✅ Moved Starship from Nix to Homebrew

**Why this change?**
- **Better reliability**: Homebrew installations often have fewer PATH and shell integration issues
- **Faster updates**: Homebrew typically gets starship updates quicker than nixpkgs
- **Shell compatibility**: Reduces potential conflicts with shell initialization

### 📦 Package Changes

**Added to Homebrew (`modules/system/homebrew.nix`):**
```
"starship"
```

**Removed from Nix packages:**
- `modules/applications/productivity.nix` - Commented out starship
- `modules/applications/productivity-simple.nix` - Commented out starship  
- `modules/workflows/shell-enhancements.nix` - Commented out starship
- `modules/workflows/shell-enhancements-simple.nix` - Commented out starship

### 🏠 Home Manager Configuration

**Kept intact:**
- Starship configuration in `home/shells.nix` and `home/shells-full.nix`
- All starship settings and customizations preserved
- Home Manager can configure programs installed via Homebrew

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Installation**: Starship binary installed via `brew install starship`
2. **Configuration**: Starship settings managed by Home Manager
3. **Integration**: Shell integration handled by Home Manager starship module

## 🧪 Testing

After deployment, verify starship works:

```bash
# Check starship is installed
starship --version

# Check starship config
starship config

# Test in new shell session
starship init zsh --print-full-init
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploy the changes:
```bash
./scripts/manage.sh build    # Test build
./scripts/manage.sh deploy   # Deploy with Homebrew starship
./scripts/manage.sh test     # Verify starship works
```

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **More reliable shell prompt**
- ✅ **Faster starship updates via Homebrew**
- ✅ **Better macOS integration**
- ✅ **Reduced Nix store dependencies**
- ✅ **Same configuration experience via Home Manager**

The starship binary comes from Homebrew, but all the beautiful configuration and customization still comes from your Home Manager setup! 🌟
